In order to run your Ethanon project in the iOS, copy both
trunk/toolkit/Source/src/gs2d/projects/Android/Ethanon/assets and
trunk/toolkit/Source/src/gs2d/projects/Android/Ethanon/data
directories into this folder, as well as your project files
Your main.angelscript file must be in the xcode/assets/ directory.
Don't need to mention that .exe and .dll files are not required
in this folder since they are windows-only files.

Open the xcode project Ethanon.xcodeproj and run it on an iOS
device or in the iOS Simulator.
